<h2><u>cs152 Lab #1: Lexical Analyzer Generation Using <i>flex</i></u></h2>
</center>

<p>
This week we will hand out the first phase of the class
project, which deals with lexical analysis using the <i>flex</i> tool.  We will also
complete an exercise that will help you get acquainted with <i>flex</i>.
</p>

<p>
Outline for today's lab:
</p><ol>
<li> Go over the first phase of the class project (handed out)
</li><li> Complete an exercise to help you become familiar with <i>flex</i>
</li><li> Begin working on the first phase of the class project
</li></ol>
<p></p>

<h3>Practice with <i>flex</i></h3>

<p>
In this exercise, we will write a <i>flex</i> specification for a lexical analyzer for a simple
calculator language.  For now, this language will contain integer numbers, the operators
plus, minus, multiply, and divide, and parentheses for grouping.  Additionally, the symbol
"=" is in the language to terminate an expression.  These symbols and their corresponding
token names are shown in the table below.
</p>

<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
   <td><b>Symbol in Language</b></td>
   <td><b>Token Name</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>integer number (e.g., "0", "12", "1719")</td>
   <td>NUMBER XXXX <font size="-1">[where XXXX is the number itself]</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>+</td>
   <td>PLUS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>-</td>
   <td>MINUS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>*</td>
   <td>MULT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>/</td>
   <td>DIV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>(</td>
   <td>L_PAREN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>)</td>
   <td>R_PAREN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>=</td>
   <td>EQUAL</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>

<p>
The calculator language itself is very simple.  There is only one type of phrase
in the language: "Expression=", where "Expression" is defined in the
<a href="Syntax Diagrams.html">similar way as for the class project</a>, except for the fact that there
are no variables in the calculator language, only numbers.  For example, all of the following
are valid in the calculator language.
</p>

<code>
21=<br>
2+3*4=<br>
(2+3)*4=<br>
30/3/5=<br>
-250/50=<br>
(10+2)*-(3-5)=<br>
40-20-5=<br>
4*(1/1-3/3+10/5-21/7+45/9-121/11+26/13-45/15+34/17-38/19+63/21-1/1+2002/1001)=<br>
</code>

<p>
Note, however, that lexical analysis only scans for valid <i>tokens</i> in the calculator
language, not valid expressions.  The parsing phase (phase 2, the next phase of the class project) 
is where sequences of tokens will be checked to ensure that they adhere to the specified
language grammar.  Thus, for this exercise which deals only with lexical analysis, even
such phrases as <code>*/2=10++-(+</code> and <code>***101***())(-</code> can still be
tokenized successfully.
</p>

<p>
<b>Task 1:</b> Create a <i>flex</i> specification to recognize tokens in the calculator language.
Print out an error message and exit if any unrecognized character is encountered in the input.
Use <i>flex</i> to compile your specification into an executable lexical analyzer that
reads text from standard-in and prints the identified tokens to the screen, one token per line.
</p>

<p>
<b>Task 2:</b> Enhance your <i>flex</i> specification so that input text can be optionally read
from an input file, if one is specified on the command line when invoking the lexical
analyzer.

</p><p>
<b>Task 3:</b> Enhance your <i>flex</i> specification so that in addition to printing out
each encountered token, the lexical analyzer will also count the following.
</p><ul>
<li> The number of integers encountered
</li><li> The number of operators encountered: <code>+, -, *, /</code>
</li><li> The number of parentheses encountered: <code>(, )</code>
</li><li> The number of equal signs encountered
</li></ul>
The total counts should be printed to the screen after all input text has been tokenized.
The counts need not be printed if an unrecognized character is encountered in the input
(since the lexical analyzer should just terminate after issuing the error message).
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Task 4:</b> For a challenge, you may want to try extending the calculator
language to allow for decimal numbers in addition to regular integers.  Thus, the following numbers
should be recognized by your lexical analyzer.
</p>

<code>
.123<br>
0.17<br>
2.171<br>
5.010<br>
171.0023<br>
</code>

<p>
For an even greater challenge, extend the calculator language to allow for scientific notation
in the numbers.  After the number, there can be an optional "e-phrase" consisting of either
"e" or "E", followed by an optional "+" or "-", followed by one or more digits.  For example,
the following numbers in scientific notation would be recognized by your lexical analyzer.
</p>

<code>
2e7<br>
2e+7<br>
2e-7<br>
2E+102<br>
5E0<br>
0.201e+17<br>
</code>
